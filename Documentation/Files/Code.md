This will mainly go over Gambit, but, so it does not get lost, I will put the other, more simple files up top.


  This is obviously related to sound within the game. This has two parts: Boss sound effects, and audio files streamed to RAM, meaning soundtracks like `Splattack!` or `Calamari Inkantation`. Before this though, there is a file called `DummySound.bfsar` in `/content/Sound/`. This is exactly what the name suggests: a dummy file that does not contain sound files.

### Sound Effects
  These are in this folder in the directory `/content/Sound/Resource/`. These are organized into `.bars` files, which are for the Story Mode bosses.

#### EnemyStampKing.bars
##### StampKing_Voice_Die.bfwav

### Soundtracks
  These are in this folder in the directory `/content/Sound/Resource/Stream/`. There is a file called `DummySound.bfsar` in Resources. This is exactly as it suggests: a dummy file that does not contain sound files.
