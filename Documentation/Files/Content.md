This will mainly go over content files, how to open them, what they are, file formats, etc.

## Env
This has a file called "BallKing.szs".

## Font
This has the file "BmpFont_US.szs".

## Message

Content here is within `.szs` files. Within these files are `.msbt` files, which are basically Nintendo's version of obfuscated `.txt` files.
## Model

This will get its own .md, to not overshadow other information in this file: [Model.md](https://github.com/Delus1onL/Splatoon-Decompile-For-Splatoon-Legends/blob/main/Documentation/Files/Model.md)
## Pack

This will get its own .md, to not overshadow other information in this file: [Pack.md](https://github.com/Delus1onL/Splatoon-Decompile-For-Splatoon-Legends/blob/main/Documentation/Files/Pack.md)
## Sound

This is obviously related to sound within the game, specifically audio files streamed to RAM, meaning soundtracks like `Splattack!` or `Calamari Inkantation`. These are in this folder in the directory `/Resource/Stream/`. There is a file called `DummySound.bfsar` in Resources. This is exactly as it suggests: a dummy file that does not contain sound files.
