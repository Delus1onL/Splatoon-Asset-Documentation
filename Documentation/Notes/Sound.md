# Sound

  This is obviously related to sound within the game. This has two parts: Boss sound effects, and audio files streamed to RAM, meaning soundtracks like `Splattack!` or `Calamari Inkantation`. Before this though, there is a file called `DummySound.bfsar` in `/content/Sound/`. This is exactly what the name suggests: a dummy file that does not contain any sound files. 
  Here are the 2 types of files:

# Sound Effects
  These are in this folder in the directory `/content/Sound/Resource/`. These are organized into `.bars` files, which are for the Story Mode bosses.

## EnemyStampKing.bars
  This is the sound effects file for the (idr name) boss.
### StampKing_Voice_Die.bfwav

# Soundtracks
  These are in this folder in the directory `/content/Sound/Resource/Stream/`. There is a file called `DummySound.bfsar` in Resources. This is exactly as it suggests: a dummy file that does not contain sound files.
