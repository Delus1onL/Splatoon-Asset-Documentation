# Splatoon-Decompile
Attempting to decompile Splatoon for Splatoon on 3DS.

## Why?
I started a project in March 2023 with the goal of porting Splatoon to the 3DS family. We named it Splatoon Legends because of the April Fools video. My part to play is attempting to decompile, while the other willing developers will remake it using devkitpro. I will use Ghidra, HxD, Cemu, WiiU, and wiiurpxtool for my part.

## What's this?
This will be where I explain and highlight what I find, as well as more in the future.

## Where can I find more information???
