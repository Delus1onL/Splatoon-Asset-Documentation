# Splatoon Asset Documentation
Documenting Splatoon to advance the homebrew and modding scene, and to learn more about technical topics.

## Why?
I started a project in March 2023 with the goal of porting Splatoon to the 3DS family. We named it Splatoon Legends because of the April Fools video. It is now more realistically a Splatoon Demake.
Now, however, in 2024, I am simply just analyzing Splatoon's content files. I work with a group named SDL Foundation, which works to decompile the game.

## What's this?
This is a place where I highlight the data contained in files, in a decrypted way. I will also have some guides here on what tools you need for files, and how to edit specific files/make specific mods.

## Where can I find more information???
